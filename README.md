Calculator Project Using HTML, CSS and Javascript This calculator helps users to perform basic addition, substraction, division, and multiplications of numbers. This project was inspired by my zeal to understand the concept of Javascript Class and Constructor. I hope this project can also inspire somebody to improve and develope greater projects using Javascript Classes and Constructors. Thanks to WebDev Simplified for the wonderful and simplified web developmemt tutorials. For comments, suggestions or encouragements, get in touch - mymailserver888@gmail.com
